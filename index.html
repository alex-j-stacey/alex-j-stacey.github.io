        <p > My name is Alex Stacey, and I'm a former attorney who after five years of practicing law decided to change careers unto a field I truly have passion for: computer science and software engineering. I enjoy building stuff, breaking more stuff, and working with data.</p>
        <p>Some of my favorite books include the Count of Monte Cristo, Brave New World, and Catch-22 - just to name a few.
